# Massa Private Key generator using Mnemonic

A mnemonic is typically used to generate private keys. The idea is to base the generation of the private key on a collection of words. This way, you do not need to remember the private key directly, but a list of words or text, which is much easier.

Note that you should still rely on randomness. You list of words should be random to avoid any issue with bruteforce attacks.
